               period, the sentiment in Donald Trump's Tweets changed relative
               to his approval rating (e.g. as he gets more popular, does he
               become more positive online?). This was a great exercise in
               learning how to troubleshoot/work with data that wasn't in
               the format I needed it to be -- I made extensive use of the
               lubridate, sentimentr, and dplyr libraries; I also brought in
               for loops! With regards to the data in use: I'm still using
               Donald Trump's Tweets, from 07/13/20 to 10/13/20 (source: the
               Trump Twitter Archive -- it's got everything I need, so I
               figured there was no need to use Twitter's API), as well as the
               dataset documenting Trump's approval ratings over the course
               his presidency (both csvs are still in the Dropbox link below!). 
               Looking ahead, for my next Milestone, I'm hoping to pivot a bit
               from Donald Trump's Twitter, and consider his language in other
               spaces (e.g. his speeches). By looking at the speech level
